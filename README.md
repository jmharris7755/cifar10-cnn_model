# cifar10-cs477-final-project
This project implements a CNN on the Cifar-10 dataset to predict images.
The model was tested using 2 different optimizer: ADAM and RMSProp, to compare the different results. 
Overall, a 78.6% test accuracy was achieved using the ADAM optimizer, and an 81.1% test accuracy as achieved with the RMSProp optimzer.

This project was built as part of the CS-477 course at the University of Idaho in the Spring 2021 semester.
